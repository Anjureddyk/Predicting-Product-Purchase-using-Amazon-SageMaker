# Predicting-Product-Purchase-using-Amazon-SageMaker
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using Amazon SageMaker that analyzes available data to determine whether a person is likely to buy a specific product. 
This cloud-based machine learning platform provides a scalable and efficient environment for model development and deployment.

## Prerequisites
Before you start the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

Python (version X.X)
Jupyter Notebook (for data exploration and model development)
Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn for data manipulation and machine learning
Access to a dataset containing relevant data, such as customer information, product details, and purchase history
Amazon SageMaker and Amazon S3 for cloud-based model development and deployment
By using Amazon SageMaker, you can take advantage of its capabilities for model training, deployment, and real-time predictions, making the entire process more streamlined and scalable.

## Create a SageMaker Instance:
